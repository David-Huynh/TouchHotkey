# TouchHotkey
Onscreen hotkeys made for Windows based tablet-like devices to increase workflow in Photoshop without a keyboard.(May work with other art programs *untested*)
**NOTICE:** some buttons are NOT fully implemented yet.


Inspired by [**kannagi**](http://kannagi.net/touchkey/) but expanded for more buttons. Remade using AutoHotkey and Python.
